# Neo-s-HUD
### **Neo's Simple DarkRP HUD** 
Neo's HUD is a simple DarkRP HUD that overrides Gmod's default DarkRP HUD. This is a test add-on that I will improve in the future. There might be some errors or bugs so feel free to contact with me via my [Steam Account](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198398369164). **This add-on only works on DarkRP game mode**. 

- You can customize the hud by typing "!hud" in game chat. That allows you to change hud's color and you can set hud "outlined"
- Feel free to add me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198398369164) to give feedback, report bugs or anything else
